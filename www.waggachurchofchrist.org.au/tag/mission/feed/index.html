				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Jesus resurrection, the church exploded in all directions into evangelism. It was the natural result of good news. Of course, in this case empowered by God&#8217;s Holy Spirit, but good news tends to spread and cause rejoicing amongst those who care. So once people realised that God Himself had sent His Son to earth to save us, they certainly recognised this as good news. Actually it was incredible news, unexpected even though foretold in prophecy. The prophecy was plain enough, but the message so incredible that people could not mentally, clearly, grasp it. How could it be that God would choose to die on our behalf. To pay for our rebellion. Yes I know He rose again, but to suffer in such a painful, hellish and humiliating manner just seems beneath God. He certainly did not have to do this. The incredible thing is He chose it out of love. Yes, that qualifies as good news. The best news ever in fact.<br />
    So there is little wonder that the &#8216;gospel&#8217; which means &#8216;good news&#8217; spread rapidly. There were 10&#8217;s of thousands of converts in a matter of weeks, as people not only realised the power of the love of God, but realised that God was still active amongst them. That was a mission minded church. They were mission minded simply because they realised what God had done and that He was still active amongst them.He has not changed. Are you exited about what God has done for you, like the early church were. That is what is needed if you are to be a mission minded Christian as God would have us all be.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are blessed to announce that we own the mission Campus!  We really had our faith stretched like never before, however we are thankful for the favour God gave us.  He really proved His faithfulness in a big way.  We would also like to thank you for all your prayers and support during the last few years. We could not have done it without you, so we want you to know that you are much appreciated.</p>
<p>So how did we do it, you might ask?<br />
We raised half the money and then got a $1.120 million loan. We thank God for the favour we had with the bank. We never wanted to have a mortgage, but we came to the realisation that God can provide in various ways and we continue to trust Him to pay it off asap. It is a flexible loan that allows us to pay it off at anytime with no penalty fees. So yes, the journey continues for us to walk in faith. One of the things I learned in YWAM is that we also are having to walk in faith. There’s never a time that we do not rely on God, and He always comes through.</p>
<p>The ministry continues to grow HERE IN SYDNEY and we have many new young and exciting staff that have joined us. On a weekly basis we run breakfast clubs in schools, teach scripture in schools, do evangelism and provide food for the poor and needy. </p>
<p>This year we have seen many people come to know Christ in our community, also had many local churches join us in evangelism. It’s been great to help mobilize the local churches to go out and make disciples. We’ve also had some great Discipleship Training Schools (DTS) take place. I never get tired of seeing the students get transformed and then seeing them go and make disciples. </p>
<p>The year 2016 and has been very challenging for us as a family. That is why I am so grateful for the grace of our Lord Jesus. He has really been carrying us through every storm and we can truly say that it has only been by grace. As you know, my dad recently passed away and I would like to thank you for your prayers. As the oldest son, it was very difficult to lead my family through this process, but it was prayer that carried me through. My dad’s death took a huge hit on us financially, emotionally and physically. However everything worked out good at the end and we were able to send him off with dignity.<br />
We have a current Discipleship Training School (DTS) running on Campus and an outreach team that’s been in India and are now in Zimbabwe. Here’s a testimony from one of our 18 year old students.  </p>
<p>“Everyday we are going to the slums and praying for and talking to people. One day we came to a flat and there was a woman sitting with her leg in a cast. She told us that she broke her leg just a week ago and that she was in pain and couldn&#8217;t do much anymore. She told us that in 3 weeks she was going back to the doctor and that she might need surgery if it doesn&#8217;t heal properly. She was a believer in Jesus but we asked her if she believed that God could heal her. She said yes, so we prayed for her. After a week had gone by we were once again in the same slum and saw her again. But she was no longer in a cast. She was walking around with TWO healthy legs. She told us that everything was good and that she didn&#8217;t need surgery! God had healed her! Praise the Lord!<br />
As I mentioned before we currently have a DTS running on base and will have 2 more this year in July and September. After heaps of prayer and seeking God, I have also decided to do formal study for a year. I’m doing a Masters in Business and Leadership and believe that it will help me extend the ministry that God has called us to do. That means that I will have to take a step back from day to day ministry on the Campus to make time for studying. Tania will continue to give oversight to our training and daily ministry departments. I will still be teaching and giving spiritual oversight as normal. We also have some new leaders stepping up to help carry the load we carry. We are really looking forward to this new venture and would really appreciate your prayers. </p>
<p>Some recent events for us: <br />
July: DTS and English as a second language school intake <br />
August:USA tour and leadership conference (Whole family) <br />
September:DTS intake and travelling to Fiji (Etienne and Elisha) <br />
October:Teaching and Ministering in India (Etienne)</p>
<p>We are very honoured to serve YWAM Sydney and find it a joy to be leading this mission. So thank you for all you prayer, support and partnership that enable us to reach nations and see communities transformed. We pray God’s richest blessing over you and your families. </p>
<p>May God bless you, <br />
Pieterse family</p>
<p>WE ARE SERVING HIM WHO IS &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Matthews is the Chief Commissioner pf <a href="https://www.everymans.org.au/">Everyman&#8217;s Welfare Service</a> &#8211; the philanthropic organisation associated closely with the Australian Defence Force, and whose role is to witness to Christ among the soldiers, and to serve their needs wherever possible.</p>
<p>Everyman&#8217;s is a faith-based organisation of high repute within the Army, seeking to build the spiritual lives of the soldiers wherever they find them  &#8211;  be that inside the Everymans&#8217;s Recreation Centres at base camp, or on the operational fields of training where their famous Everyman&#8217;s Brew Trucks are filled with goodies and beverages satisfying the soldiers needs. In this role, Everyman&#8217;s has been serving the Australian Defence Force since 1940.</p>

<p>Our local Army Base at Kapooka in Wagga Wagga has Everyman&#8217;s representatives, whilst Ken himself is based at Everyman&#8217;s Headquarters in Bandiana, Victoria. Being Chief Commissioner, Ken finds himself thrown together with many Senior Army Leaders helping to formulate delicate policies for the well-being of the ordinary soldier, particularly in relation to the more spiritual matters that a military organisation is ill-equipped to deal with. For such delicate matters as soldier suicide or PTSD, other related spiritual organisations (such as Army Chaplains, or Salvation Army Counselors) are also brought in to confer and advise.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Ken has lately (Jan. 2017) become a widower with the loss of his dear wife Leonie, who was well known for her personal qualities, ministering capacities, Christian witnessing, and ability to supply hundreds of ANZAC biscuits for the Everyman&#8217;s Brew Trucks.</p>
<p>We salute you Ken in your testing role, and pray for smoother and brighter Christian paths ahead. May God grant you the fruitfulness you seek.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update from <em>Pastor Ross Brinkman</em>, 6th January 2017:</p>
<p><em>I am saddened to have to let you know that our precious Leonie Matthews went home to be with the Lord yesterday. She has as you know been in palliative care for some time due to incurable cancer. </em></p>
<p><em>Please pray for Ken and their two young adult children as they come to terms with such deep loss. </em></p>
<p><em>Below is an extract from one of Leonie&#8217;s own news letters during her struggles with this disease. It illustrates well her faith which will produce eternal life for her.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We cannot thank you all enough. God is certainly faithful. It is wonderful thinking He is sitting beside us all the time and we need to look to Him and not be overwhelmed by what goes on. His peace is ready there for us at all times if we would only look to Him without allowing worry to come in at times. Amazing thinking He is involved in every person’s life on this earth&#8230;&#8230;.Had a reading while in hospital about the things that happen to us are not necessarily about us – God may have another purpose.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
