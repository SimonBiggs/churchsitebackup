				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the very first chapter of the Bible (Genesis 1) it is recorded that when God created life in our water on earth He said:&#8217;Let the waters teem with living creatures&#8217;. Thousands of years later this is still a good description of life on earth, and not just in the water, but everywhere. In fact the air, the water and the ground all team with life. This is so both to the plain eye and to the microscope as well. So abundant is the microscopic life in water that huge whales can survive by eating pretty much purely massive amounts of microscopic creatures. They can not see what they eat, but God has built them with the ability to simply filter out of the water what they can not see.</p>
<p>Yet for all this life which bears testimony to the creation event itself, you would be hard pressed to find any living creatures that are still alive from the time of Christ recorded in the gospels (2000 yrs ago). You might find some sort of coral or tree perhaps. Most of life turns over very frequently indeed. All creatures die. This is evidence of the curse of sin. Why after all should all creatures age and loose efficiency. We are so used to aging that we take it for granted. However, what is the purpose of aging? Other than evidence for the curse of sin, what reasonable explanation would we have for every living creature having a use by date, even if they grow or dwell in perfect conditions for sustaining their life. It seems wasteful. Imagine how much quicker man&#8217;s knowledge would have increased if all were alive right from the time of Adam and Eve. However, when Adam and Eve rebelled against God by disobeying Him, God built in a redundancy to life, turning it over life after life so that a harvest of permanent people (in new bodies) could be obtained. A people who choose obedience. But of course to believe this you will have to do what Adam and Eve failed to do, trust God. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8216;&#8230;the <span class="small-caps">Lord</span> God made the earth and the heavens&#8217;  (Gen 2:4) That is a really simple statement but it sure makes a huge difference if you actually believe it.</p>
<p>David Attenborough is quite famous for his documentaries on nature. However I find him somewhat frustrating, as he always works from the point of view that there is no God and nature is just a fluke of some gigantic size. I would really like to redo the commentary on one of his documentaries to marvel at the work of the creator.  I see the same amazing facts that David presents and it means a completely different thing to me. Tens of thousands of shear coincidences over millions of years without a significant understanding about how it all got started in the first place is not the way I think. I want to gaze at the things of nature and think &#8220;Wow, God made that.&#8221; I want to gaze at the things made by man too, and think &#8220;Wow, we truly are made in His image.&#8221;</p>
