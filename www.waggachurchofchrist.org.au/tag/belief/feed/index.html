				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What you achieve in life is not what saves you. If it were then your salvation would be something you earn by dedication and effort. The Apostle Paul wrote about us being saved by faith alone, and not by works. later James wrote a little more having seen that some made the mistake of thinking that what we do does not matter. James wrote that you should see our faith coming through in what we choose to do. Not that the action earns salvation, rather the actions would now be consistent with someone who believes in and follows God.<br />
    In other words your action will display the sincerity of your heart as you believe in God. James reminds us that even the demons believe in God, they however do not follow God and are left with fear. Our faith must be accompanied by a sincere submission to God that effects who we are entirely. Jesus said it this way, &#8216;you will know a tree by the fruit it produces&#8217; for good trees do not bear bad fruit.<br />
    More than this, if I were to simply believe that there was no God then I would have to think on death and suffering as just being bad luck, so that I might as well just go and enjoy my good fortune at not being dead yet.<br />
However once I realise that God is indeed there then I must accept that suffering and death came as a result of the sin and rebellion in mans own heart. Now, I realise that the problem is not outside of me but inside of me. I, as a human being have the potential to continue in sin, which separates us from God who is without sin. As Gen 4:7 says;&#8217;sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it&#8217;. So we take a stand within our own hearts,not because we are strong, but because God is able to strengthen us as we place our trust in Him.That is faith moving us towards right thinking and actions. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever read this really great verse?</p>
<p>He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, &#8216;He is my refuge and fortress, my God in whom I trust.&#8217; Ps 91:1 (NIV)</p>
<p>If the Most High God becomes our dwelling place then it is not a static picture. He is everywhere. This means that dwelling in Him is not a matter of where you are physically. It is about where you are spiritually. If you are dwelling within Him then you are living a life of seeking to please Him. If that is who you have become then not only will you not want to come out from His cover, but while you seek to please HIm it is impossible to get out of His cover. Remember He is everywhere. He is all powerful. Or as another passage puts it&#8217; If God be fore me who then can be against me&#8217;?(Rom 8:31)</p>
<p>God is the ultimate power of this universe. He is the creator of all power. Yet His delight is in covering us with His love. Not because we are great but because this is who He chooses to be.</p>
<p>This is not like an arranged marriage. It is by free choice. God as the groom calls to us in His love; &#8216;Come, be my bride and I will love you forever more.&#8217; The heart of God desires that none would perish (2 Pet 3:9), and so none of us is predestined for hell. However God knows in advance who will and who will not respond to His love. So He says &#8216;our names are written in the Lamb&#8217;s book of life before the world was made&#8217; (Rev 13:8).  So He simply knows what we will choose. This, however, does not mean that our choice is not free. So sometimes it is very helpful to temporarily disregard predestination and simply focus on the choice. Simply choose life by choosing to follow Jesus.</p>
<p>Yeah I know, He already knows if you will or not. You however, do not know, so cut the so called deep thoughts, AND JUST START TO FOLLOW JESUS.  See it&#8217;s meant to be simple, a gospel designed not for academia but for anyone to follow.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was listening to a breakfast news show this week when the commentator made a reference to the relevance of Christmas even if you don&#8217;t believe. It stood out for me markedly. For many people today there seems to be the assumption that the events of Christmas can not be true. No investigation is made about the proofs for this event, just an assumption that it could not be true. For those of us who have read the many prophecies made hundreds of years before the birth of Christ and then gone on to look at the powerful miracle filled life of Jesus, His amazing wisdom in teaching, the way He died and  the proofs for his resurrection, the birth of Jesus is an obvious truth.</p>
<p>However if you have never bothered to really look at the evidence, you might find reassurance in your unbelief by taking note that in the current generation you are well and truly in the majority in your lack of faith. The illusion of  safety in the crowd is spoken about by Jesus Himself when He said<em> <span class="text Matt-7-13"><span class="woj">“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.</span></span> </em><span id="en-NIV-23331" class="text Matt-7-14"><span class="woj"><em><sup class="versenum"> </sup>But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it</em>. (Mt 7:13-14)</span></span></p>
