				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First He said, “I am the bread of life.He who comes to Me shall never hunger” (John 6:35).<br />
Second, Jesus said, “I am the light of the world” (John 8:12)<br />
Third, Jesus said, “I am the door” (John 10:9).<br />
Fourth, Jesus said, “I am the true vine” (John 15:1)<br />
Fifth, Jesus said, “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep” (John 10:11)<br />
Sixth, Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.” (John 11:25)<br />
Seventh, Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me” (John 14:6).<br />
Jesus said ‘I am God’s Son’ (John 10:36)</p>
<p>The resurrection of Jesus from the dead should leave us in no doubt about the favour of God over the life of Jesus Christ. His miracles and wisdom should have also done this.<br />
Today on Easter Sunday we celebrate Jesus as the the first of those who will be resurrected to eternal life.<br />
We celebrate also because in faith we know that one day we too will experience resurrection to eternal life.</p>
