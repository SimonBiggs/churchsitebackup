<p><strong>Speaker: Pastor Ross Brinkman</strong></p>
</div>
<div>&#8211; Where is your Treasure? Is it in your superannuation? Is your treasure your hobby? Is your treasure in your car, house and possessions &#8211; and do you have so much you need to build a bigger barn? This sermon looks at the following parable and the importance of having God as our treasure first.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>The Parable of the Rich Fool</strong><br />
13 Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”14 Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?” 15 Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”</p>
<p>16 And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 17 He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’</p>
<p>18 “Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. 19 And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’</p>
<p>20 “But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’</p>
<p>21 “This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.”</p>
<p>Luke 12: 13-21</p>
