<p><strong>Speaker: Phil Briggs  </strong></p>
</div>
<div>  Against the background of Paul&#8217;s defence of his ministry in the face of the work of those false apostles which followed him continually, we look at the portrait of a man mature in the things of the Spirit of God, both in his personal life, as well as in his ministry. In this we are instructed in our own growth in the knowledge of the depths of God by the Spirit.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is indeed very amazing, that God in all of His holiness can be so forgiving and full of grace.</p>
<p>Think about it, the Bible tells us that God is so holy that if a sinful man were to appear before God he would die. God’s holiness is so completely pure and spotless that the very presence of sinfulness would bring about instant judgement. God’s very holiness kills sin &#8211; wow! So how is it possible that we can enter eternal life at all? The Bible disqualifies us all by stating that all men have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. So every one of us would die in His presence.</p>
<p>Our amazing God loved us so much that He sent His own Son who is also totally holy to rescue us. Except He sent Him as a man to die in our place. This basically means that the holiness of God reached out to kill Jesus as all of our unholiness and therefore unworthiness were placed on Him. He received our death sentence.</p>
<p>Now if that were forced on Jesus it would just be an injustice. However, Jesus chose to obey His Father’s will. They both loved us together. The end result is the amazing miracle that God looks upon us now as totally holy. Our sin is actually gone. Dead. Put to death on the cross so that we can live. Let’s be frank here. I, you, we, do not deserve this. Our life is completely due to the generosity and love of God. He chose us. Now all we have to do is respond to His love and choose Him back. However, we should not forget that He chose us out of Graciousness whereas we chose Him out of Gratefulness. We are not lucky, we have been blessed by His love.</p>
