				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bible tells us in the account of creation that Adam lived 930 years. He was the very first man, living in a very different world. Eve bore him Cain and Abel but Abel was murdered by Cain. It did not really take very long for man to be reduced to murder. After this Adam and Eve had Seth through whom the line of Christ would eventually come. The Bible is unashamedly biased towards presenting the family tree that would eventually lead to Christ. So often other family lines are followed briefly while they are relevant to the journey of Godâ€™s chosen people but once they cease to be they are dropped off from the subject matter of the Bible. This following of the family lines that lead to Jesus reaches a climactic point in the New Testament in Luke 3 where we see the lineage of Christ written out all the way from Adam to Christ. This makes sense of the inclusion in the Bible of history such as that of Ruth and her marriage to Boaz as they were direct ancestor of Jesus earthly father Joseph.<br />
The Old Testament does not try to hide this intent as it repeatedly gives prophecies that look forward to the coming Messiah (Jesus). However, the reader does not get to fully appreciate the continual coming back to the direct ancestor of the Messiah until He is introduced in the New Testament and the familiar characters are all listed as a family line.<br />
Genesis 5:4 reads:   4 After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.<br />
 Now Abel was murdered and Cain the murderer was cursed but Seth would be the direct ancestor of Jesus earthly father, but the verse clearly states there are many other children both male and female born to Adam. They are not named or even numbered. Adam had another 800 years to have these children and there would have been many (Jewish tradition says about 40) but the only one important to the story line of Jesus was Seth. You get the point I hope. We are just 5 chapters into the Bible and we have clearly already started following the plot line towards Jesus, the reader however, just does not know it yet.<br />
To add further wait to this deliberate biblical story line we suddenly find that family history or lineage become almost irrelevant for the rest of the bible. Jesus, is the centre character of the biblical narrative. No wander the Bible declares that there is no other name under heaven by which we may be saved.<br />
Only God could have kept such a story line going via 40 different authors over roughly 2000 years. </p>
