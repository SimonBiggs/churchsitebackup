				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What you achieve in life is not what saves you. If it were then your salvation would be something you earn by dedication and effort. The Apostle Paul wrote about us being saved by faith alone, and not by works. later James wrote a little more having seen that some made the mistake of thinking that what we do does not matter. James wrote that you should see our faith coming through in what we choose to do. Not that the action earns salvation, rather the actions would now be consistent with someone who believes in and follows God.<br />
    In other words your action will display the sincerity of your heart as you believe in God. James reminds us that even the demons believe in God, they however do not follow God and are left with fear. Our faith must be accompanied by a sincere submission to God that effects who we are entirely. Jesus said it this way, &#8216;you will know a tree by the fruit it produces&#8217; for good trees do not bear bad fruit.<br />
    More than this, if I were to simply believe that there was no God then I would have to think on death and suffering as just being bad luck, so that I might as well just go and enjoy my good fortune at not being dead yet.<br />
However once I realise that God is indeed there then I must accept that suffering and death came as a result of the sin and rebellion in mans own heart. Now, I realise that the problem is not outside of me but inside of me. I, as a human being have the potential to continue in sin, which separates us from God who is without sin. As Gen 4:7 says;&#8217;sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it&#8217;. So we take a stand within our own hearts,not because we are strong, but because God is able to strengthen us as we place our trust in Him.That is faith moving us towards right thinking and actions. </p>
