				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>     These words,&#8217;only one opinion matters&#8217;, are the words of Billy Graham. After years of evangelistic ministry that led to around 2 million people coming to Christ, Billy Graham died this week in America aged 99 years. When he said that &#8216;only one opinion matters&#8217; he was talking about his own death and the evaluation of the worth of his life and ministry. The opinion that matters is not the opinion of man. It is the opinion of God that matters. When Graham stands before Jesus Christ he wants to hear:&#8217;Well done, good and faithful servant&#8217;. </p>
<p>When we hold funerals, many things are said about the deceased. After running many such a funeral, I am left with a solid understanding of the fact that no words from fellow men really summarize a life. It is also a simple fact that no one completely knows us from the inside out like God does. We can look great but have all the wrong motivations inside us. God sees past all this because He sees the heart. </p>
<p>When Billy Graham pointed out that only one opinion really matters to him about his life, this will be what matters for every single human being that ever lived. Many may not realize yet, but once they stand before the creator of all the universe for judgement after their life here on earth, they will care very deeply what God thinks. Their future will depend on it. Hebrews 9:27 says it this way;  &#8216;people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment&#8217;.</p>
