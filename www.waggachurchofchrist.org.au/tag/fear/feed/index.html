<div>&#8211; Sin. It likes to remain hidden in us for a long time. It destroys lives. It can be relentless. But Jesus has conquered sin once and for all! Stephen looks at the story of Joseph (Genesis 37:1 &#8211; 50:21) who despite being sold off into slavery by his own brothers, remained faithful, aware to the Spirit of God, and ultimately forgave and blessed his brothers.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our world is not only full of terrorism but full of injustice and often we experience what seems like random acts of violence, like the car that ran people down in Melbourne recently. If we are not careful we could fall into the trap of becoming afraid in life rather than living it at peace before God. This can be harder at some stages of life than others, so if for example while you are young you experience danger it easy for fear to take hold. If you are older you can feel extra vulnerable as your own self defence is weaker.</p>
<p>Regardless of how hard or easy it is for you to live without too much fear, we are not meant to live in fear. Listen to what the Bible says about the way our faith can change the way we see danger:                    <i>I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more. Luke 12:4  </i></p>
<p><i>        </i>Rather we are meant to remember that our eternal life is totally in the hands of Christ. The only fear that we should entertain is that we would not please God. Even then, Christ is so forgiving that we ought to live quite at peace. Now if you are not really scared about your human body dying, many scary things like terrorism simply lose their grip on your life.</p>
<p>I love being a follower of Christ.</p>
