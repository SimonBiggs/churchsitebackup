				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> In Matthew 3:12 John the Baptist prophesied of Jesus a cleansing work amongst people.<br />
The message is more than just a message or sorting out between the saved and unsaved people. It involves the permanent removal of all that is sin or causes sin:<br />
&#8220;He will thoroughly clear out and clean His threshing floor and gather and store His wheat in His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with fire that cannot be put out.&#8221;(Mt 3:12)<br />
    Note here the words &#8216;thoroughly clear out and clean&#8217;.So not only will those who have not chosen God be gone, but the world will also be purified, made holy again as it was before man fell by taking up sin. This should challenge us all as Christians as well. For whatever is in our life that does not honour God will also be removed. Are you wasting precious time and energy on what does not matter. Think carefully over the things you value most. Will they all still remain after this great cleansing that God will accomplish. It is a sobering filter to sort your life through.</p>
