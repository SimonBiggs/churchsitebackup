				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people today simply do not realize how deeply the morals of our nation were formed in years gone by, by the Bible&#8217;s clear moral teaching. The Bible is the most printed book ever, and no book of any description comes anywhere near to the number of copies printed. Many of our laws were also formed around the Bible&#8217;s moral teaching.<br />
Even His critics would mostly recognize the outstanding moral teaching of Jesus contained in the New Testament of the Bible. Despite this simple truth, people are deserting the Bible in droves. Why?</p>
<p>In part I am inclined to blame the teaching of evolution as if it were proven when it is far from it. Evolution presents many with the excuse to believe we are no more than an accident. This leads many towards either atheism or simply with a distrust of the Bible as the story line does not match up with evolution. </p>
<p>The main problem however is far deeper than a single destructive teaching. Most if not all civilizations have eventually moved off towards sin even when they are well versed in the standards of God. The people&#8217;s desire to sin moves them away from God, for if they stay with God while sinning they will be made to feel their own guilty conscience. Living with guilt is not comfortable. However, lets also remember that living with a life of sin is also not comfortable. It may be fun for a time but because it does not come from God, it soon causes trouble.</p>
