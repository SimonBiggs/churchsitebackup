				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Matthew 18 it is recorded that people brought little children to Jesus to be blessed by Him. When they tried to stop the parents Jesus was unimpressed. He reminded them that even they, as adults, must come to Him humble like these little ones. Then Jesus went right on laying hands on the children and blessing them.</p>
<p>Those around Jesus must have considered these little ones too young for the Master to bother with. Perhaps they considered this a waste of His time too. In any case Jesus regarded them as precious.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Jesus points out that it is not just children that learn from adults. Adults also learn from children. being a parent for the first time is a huge learning curve. Then just when you think you have got it all together another one comes along and is completely different. Then later when you really think you understand this process, they both hit puberty. Yes, we can learn a lot from children.</p>
