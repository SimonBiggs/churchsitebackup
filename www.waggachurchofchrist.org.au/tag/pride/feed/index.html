<p><strong>Speaker: Pastor Ross Brinkman</strong></p>
</div>
<div>&#8211; Where is your Treasure? Is it in your superannuation? Is your treasure your hobby? Is your treasure in your car, house and possessions &#8211; and do you have so much you need to build a bigger barn? This sermon looks at the following parable and the importance of having God as our treasure first.</div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>The Parable of the Rich Fool</strong><br />
13 Someone in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me.”14 Jesus replied, “Man, who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you?” 15 Then he said to them, “Watch out! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.”</p>
<p>16 And he told them this parable: “The ground of a certain rich man yielded an abundant harvest. 17 He thought to himself, ‘What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.’</p>
<p>18 “Then he said, ‘This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store my surplus grain. 19 And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of grain laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”’</p>
<p>20 “But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’</p>
<p>21 “This is how it will be with whoever stores up things for themselves but is not rich toward God.”</p>
<p>Luke 12: 13-21</p>

</div>
<div>&#8211; Sometimes in our pursuit of Holiness, we let our own Pride get in the way of demonstrating our love towards one another. The standard of Jesus is Holiness. This is not our standard &#8211; it is Jesus, but his Holiness stems from His absolute Love and Compassion for us, and this is how we should act towards others also.</div>
