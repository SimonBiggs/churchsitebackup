				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In so many ways the reformation of the church that took place in the 1400-1500&#8217;s was a result of the development of the printing press. Today we remember characters like Martin Luther (Germany) and John Calvin (France and Switzerland) but it was the invention of the printing press that really started the reformation. With mass productions of books many more learned to read. The first book mass produced was the Bible. The Bible quickly became more available than ever before to a public who could increasingly read. Those who wanted to maintain total control tried to stop the average person having access to the Bible for themselves. However, characters like Martin Luther began to defy them by translating the Bible into other languages and having it printed. Having your own Bible is an amazing privilege. A privilege that changed the world.<br />
            What about Today?<br />
Today when you read your Bible you can be directly instructed by God&#8217;s Word. It is the Bible that helps us understand why we are here and who we really are. Created in the very image of God as the highest creation on earth, and created to do good works as well as to worship and honour God. We are a people of prayer, worship and service; a people who are meant to live humbly before our God. More than this, we are to take up our cross metaphorically (humble sacrificial service) and follow Jesus even while we live in this corrupt world. However, unless you read and digest your Bible regularly and prayerfully, you will get distracted by all sorts of pursuits that are truly unworthy of your life&#8217;s efforts and time. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We may be living in a country where the Christian faith is shrinking but this is not so everywhere. It is happening in the 1st world countries but Christianity is by far the most prevalent and popular religion in the world. 2.1 billion people claim to be Christian around the world. That&#8217;s almost twice the number of it&#8217;s nearest rival Islam.<br />
The point is that our so called 1st world countries which tend to think of themselves as the most advanced are the only ones talking about a post Christian world. However these are the countries that are unfortunately crumbling from the inside out morally. In other words they are falling more and more out of step with Godly morals. These countries have become proud of their knowledge and achievements. However they forget that the power of their nations was gained while being relatively faithful to God. This meant they would receive God&#8217;s favour as they have done in the past. However, when a nation leaves God behind the favour of God will no longer be poured out on them. Sadly very few either care or understand this. Our country like many others is turning from it&#8217;s faith in exactly the same manner as Ancient Israel did. It did not work out well for them. What makes us think it will work out any better for us. Pray for our nation. Remember Daniel prayed for his nation even after they had been taking off into exhile due to their unfaithfulness. Yes pray for our nation. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Psalm 5:3 (NIV)</strong><br />
<em>“In the morning, LORD, you hear my voice; in the morning I lay my requests before you and wait expectantly.”</em></p>
<p>Now that is a great way to start the day. Lay it down before the Lord and wait with expectation. Imagine if that was the way that every person went to Church each Sunday. You would arrive wondering just what God would be doing amongst us today.  If that was also the way you started the day before work then you would find yourself looking for opportunities to share your faith and be a blessing to others.</p>
<p>The reality is that when you start the day in prayer you go through the day God aware. You begin to ask godly questions through your day. Questions like: how might I serve God best today?  Or : how can I love the people around me in a manner which pleases God and demonstrates what God is like.</p>
<p>It is a privilege that we can pray at all, but when the first activity of the day is prayer it shows our priorities in life and helps to keep them as priorities.</p>
<p>Keep on Praying. He is listening.</p>
