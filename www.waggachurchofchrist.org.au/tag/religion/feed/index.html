				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2 Timothy 3:5 tells us that in the last days people will hold to a form of Godliness yet denying it&#8217;s power. In other words religious without genuine faith and following of Jesus. The same people says Timothy, would be proud and rude and selfish and money loving.  Sound familiar. These are not a list of the fruit of the Spirit. Rather it is more like an anti-christ character list.</p>
<p>The idea that we could be involved in a religion in such a superficial manner is all about us. There is pressure to accept all paths to God as being genuine. God Himself only offers life through His Son Jesus, but people do not want to hear the actual truth. Rather, they are after a fast food style religion. That is they are after a religion where they can grab and go. They are after a religion which appeases the conscience but does not challenge it too much. They are after a comfortable religion.</p>
<p>The trouble is that Jesus is not offering us comfortable. He is offering us life to its full, but life in its full includes trials and hardship that would grow us and stretch us. Just as importantly, God requires us to be accountable for our deeds and even our thoughts. This is something people do not want. Just as the quick takeaway meal may not give your body what it needs, fast food religion will not give eternal life. That is only found by being a genuine follower of Christ. He has to be number one.</p>
