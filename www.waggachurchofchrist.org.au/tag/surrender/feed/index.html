				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can not bargain with God. There is nothing you can offer that He did not create and nothing He can not produce elsewhere without your help. It is so easy for us to try to control or manipulate God. It does not seem to make a difference that God can not be manipulated, we, that is mankind, and yes even Christians, keep on trying. What do I mean by this? We tend to bargain with God in our prayers to try and get him to do what we want.<br />
Have you ever prayed like that? I know I have. Prayers asking God to heal and asking God to give us what we selfishly want and asking that God would control circumstances, in just the way we wish. How very wise of director me, to tell God how to better do His role. Really? Have you ever noticed that there is no peace in a worship like that. True peace only comes one way with God. It comes in unconditional surrender. God must reign over our lives.<br />
If we continue to try to manipulate God we will not really be in service to God. You can still tell God your hearts desire that God would heal or set free someone or provide a need, but when you surrender to Him you will be in service whether He says yes or no, and you will not be trying to control, but will be expressing your love. When you consider that God describes Himself as being love, doesn&#8217;t it make sense that He would want our prayer life to reflect this?      </p>
