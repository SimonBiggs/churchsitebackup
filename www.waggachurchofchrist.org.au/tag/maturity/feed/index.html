<div>  Against the background of Paul&#8217;s defence of his ministry in the face of the work of those false apostles which followed him continually, we look at the portrait of a man mature in the things of the Spirit of God, both in his personal life, as well as in his ministry. In this we are instructed in our own growth in the knowledge of the depths of God by the Spirit.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all it is not about age.</p>
<p>Although we should certainly grow in spiritual maturity as we get older, it does not happen by accident. Maturity also does not just happen because you spend time reading the Bible, although that certainly helps!</p>
<p>I have also known people who pray a lot and yet are not mature Christians.</p>
<p>The Bible indicates that a mature Christian will have learned by practice to determine good and evil.</p>
<p>A mature Christian will have learned to forgive and to stay faithful even under terrible trials, and they will have learned to resist temptation.</p>
<p>It is not just learning however, that makes us mature in Christ. A mature Christian has matured<em><strong> in Christ</strong></em>.</p>
<p>It is the dwelling in Christ that effectively matures us. The Holy Spirit brings to us the very presence of Christ Himself so that our lives become saturated in Him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong><em>&#8220;For me&#8221;</em></strong> said Paul the Apostle, <em><strong>&#8220;to live is Christ&#8221;</strong></em>&#8230;.. (Philippians 1:21)</p>
