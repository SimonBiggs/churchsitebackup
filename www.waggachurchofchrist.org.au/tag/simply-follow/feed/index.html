				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever read this really great verse?</p>
<p>He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, &#8216;He is my refuge and fortress, my God in whom I trust.&#8217; Ps 91:1 (NIV)</p>
<p>If the Most High God becomes our dwelling place then it is not a static picture. He is everywhere. This means that dwelling in Him is not a matter of where you are physically. It is about where you are spiritually. If you are dwelling within Him then you are living a life of seeking to please Him. If that is who you have become then not only will you not want to come out from His cover, but while you seek to please HIm it is impossible to get out of His cover. Remember He is everywhere. He is all powerful. Or as another passage puts it&#8217; If God be fore me who then can be against me&#8217;?(Rom 8:31)</p>
<p>God is the ultimate power of this universe. He is the creator of all power. Yet His delight is in covering us with His love. Not because we are great but because this is who He chooses to be.</p>
<p>This is not like an arranged marriage. It is by free choice. God as the groom calls to us in His love; &#8216;Come, be my bride and I will love you forever more.&#8217; The heart of God desires that none would perish (2 Pet 3:9), and so none of us is predestined for hell. However God knows in advance who will and who will not respond to His love. So He says &#8216;our names are written in the Lamb&#8217;s book of life before the world was made&#8217; (Rev 13:8).  So He simply knows what we will choose. This, however, does not mean that our choice is not free. So sometimes it is very helpful to temporarily disregard predestination and simply focus on the choice. Simply choose life by choosing to follow Jesus.</p>
<p>Yeah I know, He already knows if you will or not. You however, do not know, so cut the so called deep thoughts, AND JUST START TO FOLLOW JESUS.  See it&#8217;s meant to be simple, a gospel designed not for academia but for anyone to follow.</p>
