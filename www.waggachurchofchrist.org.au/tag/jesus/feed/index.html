<div>  Against the background of Paul&#8217;s defence of his ministry in the face of the work of those false apostles which followed him continually, we look at the portrait of a man mature in the things of the Spirit of God, both in his personal life, as well as in his ministry. In this we are instructed in our own growth in the knowledge of the depths of God by the Spirit.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>    Some people get all negative about Christmas. I know, my Dad was one of them. Our family was not allowed to celebrate Christmas most years. This was despite the fact that Dad believed in Jesus and considered himself a Christian. The problem was that he was convinced by a radical cultic group who taught that Christmas and the date of Christmas were really a satanic or at the least pagan event. There are people who would argue that the date chosen for Christmas was used for the celebration of worship of the Sun. A type of solar festival was held in Rome on that date.<br />
    Quite frankly this has nothing to do with our current Christmas. Even if the date was used for other things it does not contaminate the worship of God today or the celebration of the miracle of the virgin birth, or the coming of the promised Messiah. It is not even the same date in all countries. Orthodox churches such as that in Egypt celebrate Christmas on December 7th. The Armenians celebrate it a day earlier.<br />
The Difference in calendars mean that due to the different handling of leap years the orthodox Christmas will move to Dec 8th by 2100. Who cares about the date. Jesus is the centrally most important figure in all history. He is the son of God and the saviour of our very souls. Why would we not celebrate his birth. It does not matter what the real date actually was, we simply are not quite sure what the date was. Who cares, it was never the day that was holy, it is Jesus. My dad got is wrong. Celebrate Christmas this year and do it well. Oh, don&#8217;t let the shops get you too caught up in the modern economics of Christmas, just share the love of God and remember that Jesus really is the reason for the season. Remember who he is, and what he stands for. Not just who he was. Remember, He Is still Alive.</p>
