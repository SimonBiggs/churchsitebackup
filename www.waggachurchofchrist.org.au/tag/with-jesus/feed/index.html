				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day we will stand in the very presence of Jesus Himself. Oh, He is always with us, but one day we will physically stand before Him with our life on earth left behind permanently and only our life with him remaining for all eternity.<br />
    I was pondering the things that shall disappear when this happens, and it occured to me that our lives there will be almost unrecognisable from our current world. Sin will not be present. It will not be in our character any more. Not only will sin be gone but the things that cause sin and temptation as well (Mt 13:41).<br />
    1 Cor 13:8-12 tells us that what we see now (of God) is like a poor reflection in a mirror. Prophecy gives us a partial knowledge but when we are with God we will no longer need it. Tongues help us pray and worship amongst other things, but once we are perfect ourselves and standing before his presence we will no longer need tongue. History is being unravelled by archaeology but with lots of educated guess work needed along the way. Once we are given Godly knowledge we will not need to go looking in the dirt for clues of our past. So much of our lives are spent in pursuing careers and gaining financial security in this world, maintaining health in declining fragile bodies with clear time limits on their life. All of these things will pass away into history. Sickness, death, war, starvation, and the list goes on. What a glorious plan God has for our future. Sadly, many who now live focus so totally on this world and do not seek to please God at all. They too will pass away from God&#8217;s presence. What a waste of the gift of life. God gives free choice. I choose to dwell in God&#8217;s presence. Not just in the future, but now, and I am looking forward to living in His world where there is no sin. A world full of life and love. </p>
