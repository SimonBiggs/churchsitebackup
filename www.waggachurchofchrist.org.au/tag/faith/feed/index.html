				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Mark 9 we read about a man whose son is struggling with demon possession and has been harmed by it many times. The Man is struggling to believe that Jesus can heal. It is not just about the trust he has in Jesus. It is also abut how terribly powerful his negative experience has been with the affliction of his child. The man famously turns to Jesu and asks: &#8220;If you can do anything, have compassion on us&#8221;. He has focussed on Jesus ability and done so with some doubt and yet with some hope as well. It is a very human mixture indeed.<br />
    Jesus however does not allow that this is an OK way to think. In fact Jesus turns this back on the man. &#8220;All things are possible for him who believes He replied&#8221;. This means it should not be about the healers faith. It should be about your own. However Jesus goes on to heal the boy. The fact is that He did have compassion. He just seems reluctant to reward the type of thinking that casts doubt on the power of God.<br />
   When we pray, Scripture tells us not to expect an affirmative answer if we do not genuinely believe. God desires that those coming for requests be genuine in their faith. It is impossible to please God without faith.<br />
Yet, there are many readers who have been very happy to see this account in the bible. It gives them hope seeing that others come to God with doubts at times. It is not a good way to come. Yet the really important issue is that He did come, and that hope that he held out is a character trait that God also loves. Especially when that hope is born out of love, such as the love this man had for his son.<br />
    Father, we pray increase both out faith and our hope that you many flow through our lives in power uninhibited.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people look upon faith as being ridiculous, however the truth is that we all live by faith all the time. Every time I sit on a chair I sit confidently by faith believing wholeheartedly that the chair will hold my weight. I may have developed that faith by experimentation and observation but the faith has developed and is there with me continually.<br />
    Faith is simply the belief in what we can not see. So although we see the things God has made and we have relationships with the people and animals He has made, and we experience with all our senses those things, we can not see Him. That may be true but God has also created many things that surround us which can not be seen. The thing about things that you can not see is that whether you have faith that they are there or not, they continue to be there even though you can not see them. You can not see oxygen, but if it is not present you will die. You can not see bacteria but it will still make you sick. You can not see radio waves but they still affect our world. You usually do not see light rays themselves even though they illuminate and display other things. You will not see radiation but you better believe it is there enough to stay clear or it will kill you whether you believe or not. You can  not see love though you will somehow notice it. You can not see God either, and though this may fase many, we see the truth of His teaching and the evidence for His biblical teaching, and we see sinful tendencies in man and death just as the Bible predicted. There is plenty of evidence for God in this highly complex and yet delicately balanced world. However in the end you will not find God in all this unless you really honestly seek Him. God declared in the Bible that we would not find Him unless we seek Him with all our heart.</p>
