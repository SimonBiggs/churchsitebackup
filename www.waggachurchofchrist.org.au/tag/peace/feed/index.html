				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week we had our church family camp. We studied prayer together. One of the things that came out was that prayer is not all for God who knows what our needs are in advance anyway. Rather, prayer is a cooperation with God.<br />
I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I pray, one of the things I am trying to do is to centre my mind and spirit on the Lord. In so doing I find myself more peaceful within myself. Less conflicted in thought and more whole. </p>
<p>Isaiah 26:3 says:<br />
You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all whose thoughts are fixed on you! (NLT)<br />
Perfect peace, WOW. Now I don&#8217;t think that perfect peace in this life necessarily means there is peace all around us. Some times life can be hectic and we can find ourselves around other people who have no interest in seeking God out in their thought life let alone trust Him. </p>
<p>Rather, I like to think that seeking God out, puts you firmly in the eye of the storm. You can see turmoil happening perhaps even all around you, but somehow you are at peace within because of where you are, nestled into the centre, in God, with a knowledge that you are safe.</p>
