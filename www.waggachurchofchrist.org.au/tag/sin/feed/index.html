				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What you achieve in life is not what saves you. If it were then your salvation would be something you earn by dedication and effort. The Apostle Paul wrote about us being saved by faith alone, and not by works. later James wrote a little more having seen that some made the mistake of thinking that what we do does not matter. James wrote that you should see our faith coming through in what we choose to do. Not that the action earns salvation, rather the actions would now be consistent with someone who believes in and follows God.<br />
    In other words your action will display the sincerity of your heart as you believe in God. James reminds us that even the demons believe in God, they however do not follow God and are left with fear. Our faith must be accompanied by a sincere submission to God that effects who we are entirely. Jesus said it this way, &#8216;you will know a tree by the fruit it produces&#8217; for good trees do not bear bad fruit.<br />
    More than this, if I were to simply believe that there was no God then I would have to think on death and suffering as just being bad luck, so that I might as well just go and enjoy my good fortune at not being dead yet.<br />
However once I realise that God is indeed there then I must accept that suffering and death came as a result of the sin and rebellion in mans own heart. Now, I realise that the problem is not outside of me but inside of me. I, as a human being have the potential to continue in sin, which separates us from God who is without sin. As Gen 4:7 says;&#8217;sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it&#8217;. So we take a stand within our own hearts,not because we are strong, but because God is able to strengthen us as we place our trust in Him.That is faith moving us towards right thinking and actions. </p>

<div>&#8211; Sin. It likes to remain hidden in us for a long time. It destroys lives. It can be relentless. But Jesus has conquered sin once and for all! Stephen looks at the story of Joseph (Genesis 37:1 &#8211; 50:21) who despite being sold off into slavery by his own brothers, remained faithful, aware to the Spirit of God, and ultimately forgave and blessed his brothers.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: right;">This week I had to waterproof a floor so it can be tiled. This got me thinking to myself that it is such a pity we cannot sin proof our lives. It would be wonderful if we could though. We can get quite disappointed by the presence of sin in our lives and in particular, the times we have to battle the same sin over and over.  Well, the Bible does give great paths for us to follow in our desire to become sin free. Firstly, we need to become Christ-centred rather than self-centred. This will also mean that we become a people of prayer as we pursue God Himself. Then we need to stop feeding sinful behaviour by exposing ourselves to temptations. Meditating on God’s word will also increase us in Him and reduce the hold sin has on us.</p>
<p>Then there is the forming of honest and genuinely accountable friendships which mean we can give positive social encouragement to walk in a Godly manner. Then on top of this we are encouraged to go on being filled with God’s Holy Spirit who will lead us and teach us about Jesus.</p>
<p>The truth is that many Christians already know these things, but you must really want to seek this path. Sadly, many people are simply happy being reasonably good rather than being everything God intended for them.</p>
