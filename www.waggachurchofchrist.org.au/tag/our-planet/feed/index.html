				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>    It is only in recent times that our leaders have got to the stage where they can start talking about managing the planet. Before that, some leaders were concerned about the conquest of the world but they always assumed that the planet itself would just stay stable. Think about it for a moment, not only did they not understand how the planet worked but they had very little idea about even the basic questions such as whether the planet was square and flat or round or a sphere. They had no real idea how unbelievably tiny Earth is in comparison to the universe. They didn&#8217;t even know what a germ was, or that microscopic life swarms all around them and even inside them all the time. Take us back just 200 years and people were really very primitive in their science and knowledge. Now, just 200 years later and we are talking about the planet as if we owned it and ran it. Almost as if we made it or controlled it.<br />
     It is good that we are thinking about how we might not harm the earth in the way we live. This is especially true as we have greatly increased in numbers. However, it is not our planet and it never was. God made it and God makes it continue. Unfortunately we make the same mistake with our &#8216;own&#8217; lives. We think we &#8216;own&#8217; them. We did not create our lives and we did not create the things that sustain the lives we live. They are our lives in the sense that God has given us freedom of choice, but if we forget that God in the Master of it all, we choose to live in a delusion that will inevitably come to an end when God decides it must.   </p>
