				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>    The Authority of God&#8217;s Word comes under attack in so many ways. If you are not a Christian than you probably will not regard the bible as having authority over your life. However if you are a christian then it should have authority over your life. Now don&#8217;t get me wrong here, even a non-christian is going to be accountable to God in the end weather they believe in Him or not does not change the fact that He made all things and has promised to reign all sin in, at the end when He returns to judge the living and the dead. Right now however we are seeing some divide even in Christian circles over the issue of weather the homosexual lifestyle is sin or not. We love people weather they sin or not so this is definitely not about hate or discrimination. The problem here is not about the bible. It is not unclear or even difficult to understand. It simple states that this behaviour is sin, even detestable before God, like all sin. Romans 1 is the easiest to understand. The bible has only one definition of marriage available and it is the one that matches our physiology i.e between a man and woman. So what is really happening here is people are starting to rebel against what the bible teaches and teach their own ideas. Well there is nothing new about this. In the end this is the real problem. Not our sexuality, but the lack of trust in the Word of God and therefore in God Himself. Dark days are here when even people in the church refuse to trust and obey God&#8217;s Word. The current vote is only a symptom of the bigger issue. God&#8217;s Word must be honoured and trusted. Or else we dishonour God Himself. That, I want to say, will not end well.</p>
