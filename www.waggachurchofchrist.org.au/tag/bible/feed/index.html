				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In so many ways the reformation of the church that took place in the 1400-1500&#8217;s was a result of the development of the printing press. Today we remember characters like Martin Luther (Germany) and John Calvin (France and Switzerland) but it was the invention of the printing press that really started the reformation. With mass productions of books many more learned to read. The first book mass produced was the Bible. The Bible quickly became more available than ever before to a public who could increasingly read. Those who wanted to maintain total control tried to stop the average person having access to the Bible for themselves. However, characters like Martin Luther began to defy them by translating the Bible into other languages and having it printed. Having your own Bible is an amazing privilege. A privilege that changed the world.<br />
            What about Today?<br />
Today when you read your Bible you can be directly instructed by God&#8217;s Word. It is the Bible that helps us understand why we are here and who we really are. Created in the very image of God as the highest creation on earth, and created to do good works as well as to worship and honour God. We are a people of prayer, worship and service; a people who are meant to live humbly before our God. More than this, we are to take up our cross metaphorically (humble sacrificial service) and follow Jesus even while we live in this corrupt world. However, unless you read and digest your Bible regularly and prayerfully, you will get distracted by all sorts of pursuits that are truly unworthy of your life&#8217;s efforts and time. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Normally when you read a book you are not necessarily looking for the overall message. When you read the Bible however, if you read it without catching the overall message, you tend to miss the point and make mistakes on your understanding of the entire book&#8217;s relevance. </p>
<p>Written over many hundreds of years and many generations, the Bible is not written to simply record human history. The Bible is God&#8217;s message for man. The creator of life has given us a manual, not just on how to live but on how to enter into relationship with Him. </p>
<p>The Bible gives us an understanding of the purpose of our lives, and the broken or fallen condition of our lives.<br />
We were meant to be in relationship with God who is holy, but by becoming a sinful rebellious people we had to be pushed away from God&#8217;s presence, or He in His holiness would have had to judge and destroy us long ago. </p>
<p>The point is that even in pushing us away God has expressed His love. He pushed us away instead of destroying us, so that He could provide an opportunity for us to return to Him, having chosen to receive the cleansing forgiveness offered through the sacrifice of His own Son Jesus. God is drawing us back to Himself. It feels for us like being drawn for the first time, but God is drawing back what He created. Without His love we would be totally without hope.    </p>
