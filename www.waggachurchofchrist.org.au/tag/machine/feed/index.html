				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>    In the world of atheistic thinking man is relegated as being an accidental happening without designer and the pure result of time and chance. This is what is called naturalism. That is, nature did it all by time and chance.<br />
However this is a hard idea to accept. It may sound OK to the one who just wants to avoid the idea of there being a God in charge who we must submit to, but does it adequately describe what a person is.  There are many questions here. If we are here by pure chance then why do we experience such deep emotions? Why do we how aesthetics in our interest. Why do we all seem to have such inbuild desires like procreation and finding a purpose? Why do virtually every people group in the world spend so much time seeking who God is?<br />
    When people build robots they have to be programed and programing in things like desire and aesthetic appreciation are very difficult things to program, so much so that really it has not been achieved well at this point regardless of the effort put into it. Are we really to then accept that pure chance has achieved what mans best efforts can not, and has done so again and again and again within nature. Judge for yourself, what makes more sense, are you simply a biological machine or have you inherited a design set in motion by a master designer who gave us purpose and beauty.</p>
