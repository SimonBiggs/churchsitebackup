<p><strong>Speaker: Phil Briggs  </strong></p>
</div>
<div>  Against the background of Paul&#8217;s defence of his ministry in the face of the work of those false apostles which followed him continually, we look at the portrait of a man mature in the things of the Spirit of God, both in his personal life, as well as in his ministry. In this we are instructed in our own growth in the knowledge of the depths of God by the Spirit.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Mary arrived at the tomb and found Jesus gone, she did not immediately think about the possibility of him being resurrected. In fact none of them did when they arrived at the empty tomb, until Jesus appeared to them. Even when Jesus first appeared to Mary she first assumed him to be the gardener. Death seems so final to us. In fact Paul calls our body a body of death in Romans 7:24 and in Rom 7:25 goes on to recognize that it is only Jesus who saves us from this body of death. In other words our natural path is death until Jesus enters our life. Then our path changes from death to life. Naturally when someone dies here we grieve them even if they are a Christian with the promise of eternal life. Of course there will be grief because we will miss them until we join them which may well be a long time. Besides, for our human bodies there is still physical death whether we follow Christ or not. So all our bodies have that fate. This means that it is only by faith that we recognize that in Christ death is only a passage to the next world, a world in which we already have citizenship. It is hard talking life when our emotions are struggling with loss. At least we have the history to reflect on of the resurrection of Christ. Mary and the apostles did not have this history.  Even though Jesus had warned them many times of his death and resurrection, and the prophets from Scripture which they had read from youth had prophesied it, Jesus physical resurrection was a real shock. A delightful one, but a shock. Now, when we lose someone it is helpful to remember that if they have faith in Christ they are not really dead at all. Just their physical body,  AND, they WILL get a new one. Getting that firmly into your head can be hard when we physically see death.</p>
