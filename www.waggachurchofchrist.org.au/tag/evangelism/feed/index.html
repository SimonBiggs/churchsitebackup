				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Matthew 7:6 Jesus is recorded as advising us not to cast our pearls before swine. Now there are many applications to this but today I wanted to point out a thought in regard to sharing our faith. God loves all people and so in the real sense there is no swine amongst us. However, many people are simply not interested in faith whether it is truth or not. So we must be careful not to spend too much of our efforts trying to convince people who are not interested whether it is truth or not. These people will not take us seriously and will certainly not appreciate our efforts. Of course we still get to love them. Some people who have been completely uninterested have become very interested due to the persistent and amazing love that comes their way from Christians they encounter. Another thing we can do is to pray for their hearts to be softened towards the Gospel of Jesus Christ.<br />
What we must not do is engage in arguments with such people. They do not want to listen anyway. You are most likely to receive ridicule and mocking. Your efforts to back up what you say will be unlikely to be taken seriously. The problem is that they themselves at this point simply do not care. They are, in regards to the gospel, just like the swine that takes whatever food is offered without any gratefulness (in this case towards God, or you) and they will not think twice about turning on you for your efforts.<br />
Don&#8217;t stop loving them or praying for them. However, to try and force faith into someone is like hitting your head repeatedly against a wall. Neither helpful, nor enjoyable, nor is it terribly spiritually edifying. </p>
