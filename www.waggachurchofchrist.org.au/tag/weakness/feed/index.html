				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was listening to a documentary on the Vikings earlier today. They were talking about the inability of the Vikings to understand a god who would passively lay down His life. The Vikings believed in warrior gods. So to have a powerful god not fight was beyond understanding for them. They wrote him off as a weakling.</p>
<p>When you think about it the notion does seem ridiculous. Why would God who is all powerful simply surrender His own son to die at the hands of a rebellious sinful and very weak people? The answer comes partly in the form of grace and love. It is the message of the famous verse of John 3:16, &#8216;For God loved the world so much that He gave is only Son that whoeverÂ believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.&#8217;</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is an answer for the Viking too. You can not really kill God&#8217;s Son. He simply rose again from the dead and displayed the power of God. He will come again next time in all of His power too.</p>
<p>Jesus humbled himself at the Father&#8217;s will to raise up a great people. Not a weakened people of slavery but a great family of God. The Vikings liked victories. Jesus won the ultimate Victory. Victory over death. It&#8217;s just that He had to die first before He could destroy it. As Scripture says&#8230;&#8217;Whoever has the Son has life, whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life&#8221; 1 John 5:12</p>
