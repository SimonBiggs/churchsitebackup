<p>Idols don&#8217;t have to be physical objects representing gods.</p>
<p>We tend to create our own idols. An idol can be anything that you value too highly so that it competes with your love of God:</p>
<ul>
<li>Money</li>
<li>A House</li>
<li>A job</li>
<li>People</li>
<li>Pride</li>
<li>A skill</li>
<li>And practically anything &#8230;..</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the things we idolise are actually quite imporant for our lives but simply elevated to a position of value that is way out of proportion.</p>
<p>Idolising things can be simply forgetting who gave them to us in the first place &#8211; why would we ever let the <strong><em>gift</em></strong> compete with our affection for the <em><strong>giver</strong></em>&#8230;who is ultimately God? The Bible says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from God&#8217;s love for them&#8221; (Jonas 2:8)</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that the best way to avoid developing idols is to work on staying in love with God through his Son Jesus Christ. If you focus on supressing your love for other things, you are working in the negative. However, when you focus on Jesus and the love coming from Him, you are &#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;running with your eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and perfecter of your faith&#8221; (Hebrews 12:1-2)</p></blockquote>
<p>It is when we take our eyes from Him that we usually get in trouble.</p>
