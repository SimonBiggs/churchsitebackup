				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>the title of a book written By Bill Hybels the Senior Pastor of Willow Creek Church in America. The title however just about makes the entire statement for the book in the first place. The real me and you is often quite secret and hidden away from other peoples view.</p>
<p>If we can change the man or woman from the the inside out then we will really be changed. The truth is however it is not really us who does the real change. However. God does it in us. However rarely does God change us without our making an effort to cooperate with him in the process. We must not however, confuse cooperating earnestly with us being able to do it on our own. The bible makes it clear that we are unable to please God without faith and that it is the Spirit of God dwelling in us that moves us towards God. It is not a contradiction that the Spirit of God would move us in that direction and ask us to keep going in that direction while He steps back a little to see if we will be motivated to follow His lead or simply turn away again. He&#8217;s always looking.</p>
<p>I remember a good Christian mother making the comment that she had come to realise that true obedience was not when her children did their chores because she commanded them to, but when they saw what was needed and simply went untold to do it. Only then will they have taken on the real understanding of what they do. It is similar with God. He teaches, empowers, encourages and nudges, even disciplines us when needed, other times he just reminds us, but to be grown we will need to want to do His will. His will starts to become our own. Then, we are truly children of the living God. Not by effort, but by nature, a nature directed by Him, not earned, but received in cooperation from His Spirit.</p>
