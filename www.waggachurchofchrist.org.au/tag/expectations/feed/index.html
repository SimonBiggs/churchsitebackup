				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine for a moment that 50 people are applying for the same job.</p>
<p>All 50 of them are also Christians, who then go and spend time in prayer asking God to bless them with this same job. Obviously God is going to have to say NO to at least 49 out of those 50 people, and YES to just 1 of them. Not only would it not be good for us to always get a yes from God, rendering us spoiled little Children, but clearly it is not even possible for God to say yes all the time.</p>
<p>When we pray we can get tempted to make it a shopping list. That is not really the point of prayer. Yes we are encouraged to bring our needs to God, but there are so many other aspects to prayer that are not self serving. Such elements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>asking for others</li>
<li>asking for wisdom</li>
<li>asking for the ability to serve</li>
<li>giving praise to God</li>
<li>asking for direction</li>
<li>asking for protection, as we risk ourselves to serve God and his people, and</li>
<li>seeking to know God better!</li>
</ul>
<p>Or how about this one, the act of surrendering to God, by choosing to recognize and live comfortable with the fact that God can be trusted with your life and future!</p>
<p>Bless you,</p>
<p>Pastor Ross</p>
