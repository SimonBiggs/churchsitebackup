				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>    The things that really matter in life must not be ignored. I know we can get really busy and allow what seems urgent to crowd out the really important things. I know this because like everyone else I can be like that myself sometimes. The problem, I have learnt however, can get much worse if we are not careful. What I mean is this: the habits we get into can become too long removed from our routine and we can soon create more permanent new routines that simply do not include the most important things in life. We need to pray and we need to be reading God&#8217;s Word regularly. These things are important because they are about walking daily and humbly with our God.<br />
     So when we are out of routine let us not forget the danger of losing good routines in God. Rather, carry your prayer life with you even into your break of routine. Pray on the go. God is always with you. Walking prayerfully with God will mean even the decisions we make on the run will have God in them. Life without God is not life at all. As Colossians 3:4 puts it, Christ is your life. </p>
