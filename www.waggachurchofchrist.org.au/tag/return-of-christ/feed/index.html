				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>    When Christ returns, it is clear that there will not be a huge church on the earth. At least not by comparison to the population. Christ made this clear repeatedly. This was not just for his generation but for later generations as the time approaches for the return of Christ. </p>
<p>The really important thing is to be ready for His return all the time. We do not know when our own time is up so we must remember that we are told to watch the times for signs of the return of Christ. We are not worshiping some make believe or man made God. Rather we worship the creator of all life. Amazingly God has chosen to put his trust in us by revealing to us His own son and even by purchasing us back from our brokenness and sin via the death of Jesus and even by the resurrection of Jesus who is the first of those to be resurrected. This proves that God is treating us not just as something expendable that can be replaced, but as precious and worth saving.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you but I can see no reason why God would chose to love us so sacrificially and so amazingly. However it is clear that he does love us deeper than we could imagine. As we move forward in life however we must not loose sight of the fact that we are temporary residence here on earth. This is not our real home. Inreality our home is not actually about a place, but about the presence of God Himself. The return of Christ is about God returning to draw us to Himself, that is, into His very presence.</p>
