<div>&#8211; We do not know when our time is up. Our lives can be snuffed out like a candle at any time. So then, knowing this, how should we live? Peter said &#8221; The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and of sober mind so that you may pray.&#8221; 1 Peter 4:7 Pastor Ross encourages us to seek the Lord and live a life of Love.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Time is an amazing thing. Great changes can happen over time and often things that have been hidden become known. Take for example the secret papers of a government that can be locked up for 50 years or more before they become publicly accessible. So the secrets become known. That is whether we like it or not.</p>
<p>Now I don’t know if you have thought about it but time is a big proof for the Christian faith. Why? Because the bible was written between 3500 and 2000 years ago, and despite the great amount of time the contents still stand as credible. This can not be said of any other book of faith. This is all the more incredible when you consider that to remain credible there was a great amount of history that had to be confirmed or at least not contradicted, and also a great number of prophecies (hundreds) that had to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Now time can cause a swing in popular thinking too. For example many doubted the existence of the Hittites people mentioned in the bible or the exodus from Egypt but eventually strong evidence was found backing up the biblical account. It has happened over and over again in history. Someone casts what they assert to be damning lack of evidence of the biblical account and then 10 ,20, or 100 years later the bible is proven correct. No other book has been so tested and yet come out on top. There are still things that some question, but I would not bet against the bible.</p>
