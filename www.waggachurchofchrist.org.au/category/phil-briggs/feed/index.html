<div>  Against the background of Paul&#8217;s defence of his ministry in the face of the work of those false apostles which followed him continually, we look at the portrait of a man mature in the things of the Spirit of God, both in his personal life, as well as in his ministry. In this we are instructed in our own growth in the knowledge of the depths of God by the Spirit.
