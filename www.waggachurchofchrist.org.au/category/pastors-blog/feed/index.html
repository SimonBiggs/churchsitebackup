				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>     There is nowhere you can hide from God. As Jonah learned you can not run from Him either. One of the places we try to hide is by living secretly inside with some disobedience to God. Even there however, there is no hiding. God sees our innermost thoughts. He knows our heart condition and sees even when we do the right thing for the wrong reasons. This is a level of accountability that we have nowhere else in life. Only God sees that deeply and that constantly into our inner world. </p>
<p>The truth is that we are often not comfortable with God seeing our every motivation and thought. However, if our hearts can not be trusted than we can not really be trusted. The problem here is that the Bible makes it clear that our hearts are deceitful beyond measure (Jer 17:9). What hope do we have then? Our hope is in the promised mercy of God. He loves us in spite of knowing our weaknesses. He longs to forgive us. He is our only hope. He is also our only avenue to change the condition of our hearts. As King David wrote in Psalm 39:7 &#8216;but now Lord, what do I hope for? I put my hope in you.&#8217;</p>

Second, Jesus said, “I am the light of the world” (John 8:12)<br />
Third, Jesus said, “I am the door” (John 10:9).<br />
Fourth, Jesus said, “I am the true vine” (John 15:1)<br />
Fifth, Jesus said, “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives His life for the sheep” (John 10:11)<br />
Sixth, Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life.” (John 11:25)<br />
Seventh, Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me” (John 14:6).<br />
Jesus said ‘I am God’s Son’ (John 10:36)</p>
<p>The resurrection of Jesus from the dead should leave us in no doubt about the favour of God over the life of Jesus Christ. His miracles and wisdom should have also done this.<br />
Today on Easter Sunday we celebrate Jesus as the the first of those who will be resurrected to eternal life.<br />
We celebrate also because in faith we know that one day we too will experience resurrection to eternal life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Approaching the time of the jewish feat of tabernacles Jesus let his brothers go on ahead believing that he would not be going. Then he went as well, but secretly. He said to his brothers about the world that:<br />
&#8216;it hates me because I testify that its works are evil&#8217;. </p>
<p>This is also why many today do not like to talk about faith and particularly Christian faith. It makes them uncomfortable with their own life choices and sin, or at the least it challenges those values they hold. People like to be comfortable in their chosen path. They do not like it when someone tells them their path is wrong. This in totally understandable for a proud person but it is also very destructive and even foolish. Imagine a person who is actively walking towards a deadly gang&#8217;s hideout. You tell them that this is not a good path to take but they treat you as a fanatical kind of person who is just scaremongering. Then without much further thought they simply continue in the same direction without fear. They have no fear because they do not believe the truth.</p>
<p>Do you get my point here? They are heading into certain danger but there is little you can do about it because they simply will not listen to you. </p>
<p>They did not like Jesus because he pointed out their sin and they will not like you when you point out their sin either. Just being a Christian can remind people of their sin, so don&#8217;t expect to be warmly welcomed as a Christian. In fact when you are it may well be a sign that God is softening their hearts. So, expect some opposition along the way. </p>

Tony then cited the humility inspired by faith that can hold us back from barbaric political plans.</p>
<p>When dictators are allowed to make their people think of them as Gods, then religion is dangerous. Religion is also dangerous when individual politicians start twisting it for their own gain as the Germans did in WWII and as the Kings leading the awful Crusades also did. </p>
<p>Equally dangerous is the misuse of science by scientists that try to assert that it is proven that there is no God.<br />
Since the proof is certainly not there and at the least highly disputed this is a dangerous way to play at science. Yes I do mean play at science.True science should consider all the facts at hand but suddenly there is a refusal to discuss the proof for God on the basis that it has already been dismissed. However, why run so hard away from this discussion if you really believe you have solid proof. Or, could it just be that these so confidently asserting scientists really just want to push there world view because it makes them more comfortable with their current lives. Not everyone wants to humble themselves before a living God.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Titus 1:9 one of the tasks of an Elder in the church is to &#8216;encourage others by sound doctrine&#8217;.<br />
So important is this sound doctrine that the next task is to rebuke the people who teach differently to sound,  Godly doctrine. The doctrine is what God wants us to believe. How is it that sound doctrine can be so encouraging? Also, if sound doctrine is encouraging then it would follow that unsound or incorrect doctrine can be discouraging.</p>
<p>Well, sound doctrine comes from God. God has a purpose for our lives. I am not talking about any specific tasks or roles He might call you to do. I am talking about the calling of each person to set aside their own desires and values in order to become the type of person God would have them be. The person who would please God will have to do it God&#8217;s way. Sound doctrine teaches us how to please God. This will always come via submission to  His Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Sound Doctrine encourages us along the right path to please God and towards eternal life. We become encouraged for several reasons. We are encouraged by sound doctrine because it gives us the hope of eternity with God. It also encourages us because it helps us do what we were created to do. Be who we were meant to be.<br />
Of course we would be discouraged by unsound doctrine which does the exact opposite. It heads us away from hope that is found in Christ alone. We then become futile in purpose. Hope is only found in God.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Luke 1:38-42 we read a fascinating account of Jesus visiting the home of Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus. Mary simply sat at the feet of Jesus while Martha got upset that she was doing all the preparation work in the background. This seems to be a totally legitimate complaint in terms of being a good host. However, when she came to Jesus to complain about her sister Jesus gently scolded her for worrying about so many things. The important thing was really to connect with Jesus himself which was what Mary had been doing. </p>
<p>I too can get distracted by life&#8217;s worries and the things I seem to think are important and even what others would think I should be doing. However I, like you, simply need to regularly sit at the feet of Jesus and follow Him.<br />
He is the source of life, what in all the world that we do could really compete with Him.</p>
<p>Whatever else you need to do in this life, don&#8217;t forget to meet with Jesus and don&#8217;t ever prioritize Him out of your daily routine.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>     These words,&#8217;only one opinion matters&#8217;, are the words of Billy Graham. After years of evangelistic ministry that led to around 2 million people coming to Christ, Billy Graham died this week in America aged 99 years. When he said that &#8216;only one opinion matters&#8217; he was talking about his own death and the evaluation of the worth of his life and ministry. The opinion that matters is not the opinion of man. It is the opinion of God that matters. When Graham stands before Jesus Christ he wants to hear:&#8217;Well done, good and faithful servant&#8217;. </p>
<p>When we hold funerals, many things are said about the deceased. After running many such a funeral, I am left with a solid understanding of the fact that no words from fellow men really summarize a life. It is also a simple fact that no one completely knows us from the inside out like God does. We can look great but have all the wrong motivations inside us. God sees past all this because He sees the heart. </p>
<p>When Billy Graham pointed out that only one opinion really matters to him about his life, this will be what matters for every single human being that ever lived. Many may not realize yet, but once they stand before the creator of all the universe for judgement after their life here on earth, they will care very deeply what God thinks. Their future will depend on it. Hebrews 9:27 says it this way;  &#8216;people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment&#8217;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day we will stand in the very presence of Jesus Himself. Oh, He is always with us, but one day we will physically stand before Him with our life on earth left behind permanently and only our life with him remaining for all eternity.<br />
    I was pondering the things that shall disappear when this happens, and it occured to me that our lives there will be almost unrecognisable from our current world. Sin will not be present. It will not be in our character any more. Not only will sin be gone but the things that cause sin and temptation as well (Mt 13:41).<br />
    1 Cor 13:8-12 tells us that what we see now (of God) is like a poor reflection in a mirror. Prophecy gives us a partial knowledge but when we are with God we will no longer need it. Tongues help us pray and worship amongst other things, but once we are perfect ourselves and standing before his presence we will no longer need tongue. History is being unravelled by archaeology but with lots of educated guess work needed along the way. Once we are given Godly knowledge we will not need to go looking in the dirt for clues of our past. So much of our lives are spent in pursuing careers and gaining financial security in this world, maintaining health in declining fragile bodies with clear time limits on their life. All of these things will pass away into history. Sickness, death, war, starvation, and the list goes on. What a glorious plan God has for our future. Sadly, many who now live focus so totally on this world and do not seek to please God at all. They too will pass away from God&#8217;s presence. What a waste of the gift of life. God gives free choice. I choose to dwell in God&#8217;s presence. Not just in the future, but now, and I am looking forward to living in His world where there is no sin. A world full of life and love. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>    The things that really matter in life must not be ignored. I know we can get really busy and allow what seems urgent to crowd out the really important things. I know this because like everyone else I can be like that myself sometimes. The problem, I have learnt however, can get much worse if we are not careful. What I mean is this: the habits we get into can become too long removed from our routine and we can soon create more permanent new routines that simply do not include the most important things in life. We need to pray and we need to be reading God&#8217;s Word regularly. These things are important because they are about walking daily and humbly with our God.<br />
     So when we are out of routine let us not forget the danger of losing good routines in God. Rather, carry your prayer life with you even into your break of routine. Pray on the go. God is always with you. Walking prayerfully with God will mean even the decisions we make on the run will have God in them. Life without God is not life at all. As Colossians 3:4 puts it, Christ is your life. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Jesus resurrection, the church exploded in all directions into evangelism. It was the natural result of good news. Of course, in this case empowered by God&#8217;s Holy Spirit, but good news tends to spread and cause rejoicing amongst those who care. So once people realised that God Himself had sent His Son to earth to save us, they certainly recognised this as good news. Actually it was incredible news, unexpected even though foretold in prophecy. The prophecy was plain enough, but the message so incredible that people could not mentally, clearly, grasp it. How could it be that God would choose to die on our behalf. To pay for our rebellion. Yes I know He rose again, but to suffer in such a painful, hellish and humiliating manner just seems beneath God. He certainly did not have to do this. The incredible thing is He chose it out of love. Yes, that qualifies as good news. The best news ever in fact.<br />
    So there is little wonder that the &#8216;gospel&#8217; which means &#8216;good news&#8217; spread rapidly. There were 10&#8217;s of thousands of converts in a matter of weeks, as people not only realised the power of the love of God, but realised that God was still active amongst them. That was a mission minded church. They were mission minded simply because they realised what God had done and that He was still active amongst them.He has not changed. Are you exited about what God has done for you, like the early church were. That is what is needed if you are to be a mission minded Christian as God would have us all be.</p>
